# Description

The game is simple, the goal of the game is to escape the maze.

There are 3 main elements:

-   Player
-   Maze
-   Enemies

The player can shoot with a certain fire rate and has 2 different play mode: first person and third person.

The enemies are the snowmen who move through the maze to guard the exit.

The game ends when the player dies or when he manages to get out of the maze.

The mazes were randomly generated, with each run choosing a random one from the existing ones.

The animation when an enemy dies is made in the Vertex Shader with a sound function.
